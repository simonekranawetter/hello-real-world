# 100 days of internship preparations

## Day 1 (23rd of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Omg, it is time. Last exam of the year submitted. Let's gooo! It feels like it's been forever and coming from C# getting rid of "var" and using "let" is going to take a while.
I have 3 months to tackle this. I have a lot to learn. Am I motivated? You bet I am.

What did I do today you ask?

+ Pluralsight Course on [Getting Started with Javascript](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-getting-started/) Modules 1-4 and coding along.

+ [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html) Chapter 1 on Values, Types and Operators

## Day 2 (24th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Day 2 hype. Watched the "Mastering Git" course on Pluralsight with my group mates for my agile course. I'll count that as a nice refresher. I even messed up the history of this project a bit, just because I am still learning GitKraken. Command line seems easier sometimes, but GitKraken has pretty colors. It still feels like I'm breezing through things, but there's nothing advanced yet, this is still all fun and games. ~~I,... promise.~~ ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ.
Github Summerfest was a fun break, I even learned a bit more about Github Actions. Now all I need is more time to really start nerding out. I also accidentally crashed my browser coding along with the pluralsight course. Endless loops are a thing in JS too. You could say it is going well. Eloquent JS mentioned semicolons for the first time and I am scared.

Signing off for tonight. Today was a good day. I know things. ~~Until I don't. And then it gets interesting.~~ (Sidenote: I use the US layout for typing code and finding the tilde just nearly broke my last remaining braincell. Things are really going well today. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ) Respecting my hard cut off today at 8PM. I'll finish the last exercise in chapter 2 tomorrow. (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳

## Day 3 (25th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

I just had to consult ~~the bible~~ Stack Overflow because I hate nested loops. That [last exercise](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#i_swb9JBtSQQ) in Eloquent JS Chapter 2 really kicked my butt. Fun fact, it's basically an easier version of [Advent of Code 2020 Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3), so my past faliures have come to haunt me (and that just means when I'm done with Eloquent JS I'll tackle this years Advent of Code in JS).
