# 100 days of internship preparations

## Day 1 (23rd of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Omg, it is time. Last exam of the year submitted. Let's gooo! It feels like it's been forever and coming from C# getting rid of "var" and using "let" is going to take a while.
I have 3 months to tackle this. I have a lot to learn. Am I motivated? You bet I am.

What did I do today you ask?

## Day 2 (24th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Day 2 hype. Watched the "Mastering Git" course on Pluralsight with my group mates for my agile course. I'll count that as a nice refresher. I even messed up the history of this project a bit, just because I am still learning GitKraken. Command line seems easier sometimes, but GitKraken has pretty colors. It still feels like I'm breezing through things, but there's nothing advanced yet, this is still all fun and games. ~~I,... promise.~~ ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ.
Github Summerfest was a fun break, I even learned a bit more about Github Actions. Now all I need is more time to really start nerding out. I also accidentally crashed my browser coding along with the pluralsight course. Endless loops are a thing in JS too. You could say it is going well. Eloquent JS mentioned semicolons for the first time and I am scared.

Signing off for tonight. Today was a good day. I know things. ~~Until I don't. And then it gets interesting.~~ (Sidenote: I use the US layout for typing code and finding the tilde just nearly broke my last remaining braincell. Things are really going well today. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ) Respecting my hard cut off today at 8PM. I'll finish the last exercise in chapter 2 tomorrow. (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳

## Day 3 (25th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

I just had to consult ~~the bible~~ Stack Overflow because I hate nested loops. That [last exercise](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#i_swb9JBtSQQ) in Eloquent JS Chapter 2 really kicked my butt. Fun fact, it's basically an easier version of [Advent of Code 2020 Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3), so my past faliures have come to haunt me (and that just means when I'm done with Eloquent JS I'll tackle this years Advent of Code in JS).

+ Pluralsight Course on [Getting Started with Javascript](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-getting-started/) Module 7 and coding along.

## Day 4 (26th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Fun fact, I've already learned more JS now than I've learned in my JS course for school. I FINALLY understand how to use it to manipulate DOM objects and why that's a good thing. I'm very confused about objects now. Made sure I really understood how objects work within functions instead of stressing on. Hoisting is,... insane. But now I'm done with the basics course and can focus on some more Eloquent JS. Onwards buttercup! Time to jump into Codewars and Exercism!

## Day 5 (27th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

My teacher didn't show up in the morning for lecture, so I decided to dive into the AWS Skill builder on AWS Lambda functions. It's a tad confusing, not having seen anything in a working project, but I am hoping it's a good base. The rest of the time I decided to make sure I know the basics I've learned the past few days and crank out some exercises on exercism. Guess what I just learned. You don't need to literally return true or false when returning a boolean. HOW has noone mentioned this in the YEAR I've been studying. Or better said, how did I not find this in my year of studying. I take it all back. Doing basic exercises is amazing. It's not boring at all. I am learning all the things.

## Day 6 (28th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Yesterday after I was done for the day, I fell down the rabbit hole of computer science talking to some friends about the way objects and strings are handled in JS and other languages. It hurt my brain, but I have learned a ton about mutability. Since today is Saturday I am taking it slow and decided to just do a quick session on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com). I love codewars, because I always have to look up how to solve things and it always leads to me seeing code problems somewhere else thinking "Hmm,... I've done this before!" and then flexing my weird nerd muscle by using this random thing.
So todays session was all about strings. Barely 10 minutes to solve both, but hey, it's my first weekend in ages. (❁´◡`❁)
P.S: Finally got Neovim to work on my VSCode! Yay! It's been a good day!

## Day 7 (29th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

First of all: Weekends are great! I love weekends! And as I learned from the almighty Tener(@ClayBoone)that breaks are important and you should take them. Also sometimes staring at clounds will help you figure things out.

## Day 8 (30th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

I ended up being extremely busy today, so I couldn't sit down much and code. But I at least read the chapter on functions today so I can get the coding done tomorrow. Sleep is a priority over getting all the things done.

+ [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html) Chapter 3 on Functions (without exercises for now)

+ Still working on [Codewars Double Char](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b1f01c247c01db92000076/train/javascript). I honestly just wanted to code for a bit but my brain was too tired to figure it out tonight.

## Day 9 (31st of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Recursion broke my brain so much today. Until maestoso(@debashisbiswas) took some time to explain it to me so my brain was able to process it. And omg did I understand it. Like the second I understood it, not getting it seemed stupid. But it ate up half my day. Definite stack overflow in my brain there for a while. But this was great. I learned a ton.

+ [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html) Chapter 3 re-read and exercises Minimum and Is Even

## Day 10 (1st of June 2022)

Dear Diary,

I realized that my pluralsight is running out in a few days, so I will be watching some more courses there the next view days. The functions course wasn't very good. Only good takeaway were rest and spread operator I guess. But that's about it. Finished the functions chapter exercises and did a quick codewars just because. 8 kyu problems are getting easy. Still have the one from a few days ago left, but it's marinating in my brain and will come to me in the shower at some point. Also, I am aware that most of those are so easy, but I am trying to catch up with a friends score and desperate times call for desperate measures. ＼（〇_ｏ）／ I should really move on to 7 kyu problems. But it's kinda nice to start having muscle memory for the easy stuff.

P.S.: Gitkraken does weird things when I amend a commit. (Just did that to fix a typo in the last commit.) Maybe I should just git bash stuff again. It's way less confusing.

## Day 11 (2nd of June 2022)

Dear Diary,

One more day with pluralsight, so here I am binging all the things. At this point that's just a nice revision. I'm also starting development on a discord bot for [The Modern Polymath](https://github.com/The-Modern-Polymath). Since this is the first time I am doing a codebase from scratch, I am trying to not make the same mistakes as other bots and building a nice config envirionment from the start is step one. I'm also considering doing it in TS from the start. Wish me luck. Zero coding so far, just living and breathing the discord.js documentation once again.

Finally solved that double char codewars kata. I KNEW there was a way to solve this in one line. I kneeew it. But I took the lazy/easy way out and ended up solving it with a for loop. It's fine, my pride is not hurt. I'm fine. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

> **str.split("").map(c => c + c).join("")**

(ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳  I'm fine. It's fine. Omg,... *of course*.
