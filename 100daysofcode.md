# 100 days of internship preparations

## Day 1 (23rd of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Omg, it is time. Last exam of the year submitted. Let's gooo! It feels like it's been forever and coming from C# getting rid of "var" and using "let" is going to take a while.
I have 3 months to tackle this. I have a lot to learn. Am I motivated? You bet I am.

What did I do today you ask?

## Day 2 (24th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Day 2 hype. Watched the "Mastering Git" course on Pluralsight with my group mates for my agile course. I'll count that as a nice refresher. I even messed up the history of this project a bit, just because I am still learning GitKraken. Command line seems easier sometimes, but GitKraken has pretty colors. It still feels like I'm breezing through things, but there's nothing advanced yet, this is still all fun and games. ~~I,... promise.~~ ヽ(✿ﾟ▽ﾟ)ノ.
Github Summerfest was a fun break, I even learned a bit more about Github Actions. Now all I need is more time to really start nerding out. I also accidentally crashed my browser coding along with the pluralsight course. Endless loops are a thing in JS too. You could say it is going well. Eloquent JS mentioned semicolons for the first time and I am scared.

Signing off for tonight. Today was a good day. I know things. ~~Until I don't. And then it gets interesting.~~ (Sidenote: I use the US layout for typing code and finding the tilde just nearly broke my last remaining braincell. Things are really going well today. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ) Respecting my hard cut off today at 8PM. I'll finish the last exercise in chapter 2 tomorrow. (ヘ･_･)ヘ┳━┳

## Day 3 (25th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

I just had to consult ~~the bible~~ Stack Overflow because I hate nested loops. That [last exercise](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#i_swb9JBtSQQ) in Eloquent JS Chapter 2 really kicked my butt. Fun fact, it's basically an easier version of [Advent of Code 2020 Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3), so my past faliures have come to haunt me (and that just means when I'm done with Eloquent JS I'll tackle this years Advent of Code in JS).

## Day 4 (26th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Fun fact, I've already learned more JS now than I've learned in my JS course for school. I FINALLY understand how to use it to manipulate DOM objects and why that's a good thing. I'm very confused about objects now. Made sure I really understood how objects work within functions instead of stressing on. Hoisting is,... insane. But now I'm done with the basics course and can focus on some more Eloquent JS. Onwards buttercup! Time to jump into Codewars and Exercism!

## Day 5 (27th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

My teacher didn't show up in the morning for lecture, so I decided to dive into the AWS Skill builder on AWS Lambda functions. It's a tad confusing, not having seen anything in a working project, but I am hoping it's a good base. The rest of the time I decided to make sure I know the basics I've learned the past few days and crank out some exercises on exercism. Guess what I just learned. You don't need to literally return true or false when returning a boolean. HOW has noone mentioned this in the YEAR I've been studying. Or better said, how did I not find this in my year of studying. I take it all back. Doing basic exercises is amazing. It's not boring at all. I am learning all the things.

## Day 6 (28th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

Yesterday after I was done for the day, I fell down the rabbit hole of computer science talking to some friends about the way objects and strings are handled in JS and other languages. It hurt my brain, but I have learned a ton about mutability. Since today is Saturday I am taking it slow and decided to just do a quick session on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com). I love codewars, because I always have to look up how to solve things and it always leads to me seeing code problems somewhere else thinking "Hmm,... I've done this before!" and then flexing my weird nerd muscle by using this random thing.
So todays session was all about strings. Barely 10 minutes to solve both, but hey, it's my first weekend in ages. (❁´◡`❁)
P.S: Finally got Neovim to work on my VSCode! Yay! It's been a good day!

## Day 7 (29th of May 2022)

Dear Diary,

First of all: Weekends are great! I love weekends! And as I learned from the almighty Tener(@ClayBoone)that breaks are important and you should take them. Also sometimes staring at clounds will help you figure things out.
