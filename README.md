# Hello, Real World!

My first internship period will start in a few months August 29th, 2022. So I decided to document my journey to learning Typescript, Vue and AWS Lambda.

And what could fit better than another round of #100daysofcode . ðŸ¤“

Read my diary [here](https://github.com/simonekranawetter/LIA-Prep/blob/main/100daysofcode.md). 


## What the heck is LIA?

LIA (LÃ¤rande i arbete) is used during your studies at a swedish YrkeshÃ¶gskola, where you get to go out into the real world and 
learn how to work as a developer in real life. Pretty intimidating at first,
since the first LIA period is after only one year of studies, but this is great. It gives you "hands on" real life experience
of what life as a programmer is like, working in a real team, producing real life ~~bugs~~ code.
