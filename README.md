# Hello, Real World!

My first internship period will start in a few months August 29th, 2022. So I decided to document my journey to learning Typescript, Vue and AWS Lambda.

And what could fit better than another round of #100daysofcode . ðŸ¤“

## What the heck is LIA?

LIA (LÃ¤rande i arbete) is a kind of internship period during your studies at a swedish YrkeshÃ¶gskola. It's a few weeks where you get to go out into the real world and 
learn how to work as a developer in real life. With real people. Working on real life projects. Pretty intimidating at first,
but it is great. It gives you "hands on" real life experience of what life as a programmer is like, working in a real team, producing real life ~~bugs~~ code.

## Do you have a plan?

Well, kind of. I plan to start out by getting a solid understanding of Javascript first, getting my basics down and taking courses with AWS Skill Builder to
get to know the AWS serverless structure better. Vue will be a nice thing to dip my toes into, but since I am more interested in all things backend, I plan to spend more time
on learning TS and JS first. Vue can be the cherry on top of the cake if I have time. 

Let's do this! I'll update my [diary](https://github.com/simonekranawetter/LIA-Prep/blob/main/100daysofcode.md) and add the things I play with to this repo.
